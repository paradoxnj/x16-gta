# x16-gta
Grand Theft Auto Clone for the Commander X16

Resolution will be 320x200.  I will attempt to use 256 colors, but 16 may be more realistic.
This is a learning experience for me as I am not that good with 6502 assembler.  I will be learning
the X16 from scratch so the code may not be optimal.  I will continue to apply what I have learned to 
optimize it as I go along.  Any input is welcome.

I am also not an artist, so I will be using public domain art from different resources.  I will add
credits to this file.

Development Environment:

Windows 10 Release 1903<br>
Visual Studio Code w/ACME Assembler Plugin<br>
ACME Cross Assember for Windows v0.96.4<br>
x16-emulator r36<br>

Paths in compile.bat are relative to the source directory.  You can change them to the locations of 
your toolchain installation.
