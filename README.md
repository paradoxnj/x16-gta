# x16-gta
Grand Theft Auto Clone for the Commander X16

Resolution will be 320x200.  I will attempt to use 256 colors, but 16 may be more realistic.
This is a learning experience for me as I am not that good with 6502 assembler.  I will be learning
the X16 from scratch so the code may not be optimal.  I will continue to apply what I have learned to 
optimize it as I go along.  Any input is welcome.
